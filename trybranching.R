# okok lets talk to myself. This is a new file to be branched and remerged soon. we are in the main branch now

# just to mess with things a bit, lets add something here in the main branch. because this is my actual problem here

# wellwell, I am now in branchybranch no 1 and am adding this conversation to myself

# sooo, but this looks right in both branches. Is this not working or what?

# oi, so it did work. still talking out of branchybranch


# I am in master now and see that both master and branchybranch have both changes implemented.

# main is ahead of things. Don't see merge request on github






# lets create some conflict out of branchybranch
